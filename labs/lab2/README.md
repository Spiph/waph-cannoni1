### Lab 2

#### Part 1

#### Part 2

##### a. stands for Ajax

##### b. CSS

See how future images for style change. style2 gang for life

##### c. jQuery

You can see here that the GET message is similar to Ajax
![jQuery GET](image-4.png)

But the POST does not have a message:
![jQuery POST Headers](image-5.png)
It is instead in the payload:

##### d. Web API Integration

Wana hear a joke? Every time you refresh, this page loads a new programming joke

I also added a fun title in everyone's favorite font

Now the fetch api.

These seem to overestimate ages by a long shot. I wonder how old this data is.
